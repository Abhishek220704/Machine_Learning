# Machine Learning Lab Assignments

This repository contains my **Machine Learning Lab assignments**, completed during my college coursework.  
Each notebook demonstrates implementation of key ML algorithms and data visualization techniques.

## 📂 Folder Contents

- **assignment 1.ipynb** – Basic introduction to ML concepts and dataset handling  
- **Box Plotting.ipynb** – Data visualization using box plots for distribution analysis  
- **DecisionTree.ipynb** – Implementation of Decision Tree classifier  
- **Naive_bayes (1).ipynb** – Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier  
- **RandomForestClassifier (1).ipynb** – Implementation of Random Forest classifier  
- **knn.ipynb** – Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm  
- **Practical_4.ipynb** – Additional practice on ML techniques and evaluation metrics  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   ```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run each cell to explore the implementation of algorithms.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
